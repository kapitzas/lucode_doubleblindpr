# lumodel_validation

This code repository contains the code accompanying the study "A predictive model of fractional land use".  

Included files:  

* _preprocessing.R:_ data preprocessing steps. 
* _simulation.R:_ the simulation of the observed land use time series from the Amazon under the naive, semi-naive and full model parametrizations.  
* _results.R:_ validation steps and code for figures ( (i) calculation of RMSE for validation of fractional amounts, (ii) overall difference between predicted and observed maps of the direction of changes per land use, (iii) agricultural expansion on natural habitat and (iv) spatial blocks cross-validation of multinomial  suitability model).  
* _functions.R_: helper functions.
